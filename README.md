<b>Project concept</b> </br>
UVision is a lamp designed to visualize UV exposure, updating daily. It adjusts its brightness based on UV levels, featuring two modes: Tanning Mode, where the lamp glows warm yellow and intensifies as UV levels rise, and UV Sensitive Mode, which turns red when UV exceeds a safe level (6+) to signal the need for sun protection. A press and hold button toggles between modes, with an ascending tone for Tanning Mode and a descending tone for UV Sensitive Mode. Designed as a functional yet decorative piece, UVision is meant to be placed on a nightstand, providing users with a quick visual cue for planning their day around UV exposure.

Built with an Arduino board, Neopixel strip for lighting, arcade button for mode switching, and a piezo buzzer for feedback, UVision is housed in a laser cut stand with a resin printed sun display. </br> </br> *For demonstration purposes, the lamp currently shows the UV monthly average for Boston in 2022.*

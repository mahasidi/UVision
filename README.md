<b>Project concept</b> </br>
For our project, we wanted to create a visualization of UV data. Our target audience are those who are hyper-aware of UV levels, whether it be to tan or to protect themselves from the rays.

So we created UVision, a light-up translucent sun display such that brightness reflects the daily UV exposure in the user’s city. The UVision would ideally be placed on the nightstand so that users can plan around the UV for the day.

For our UVision prototype, we used historical UV Index Data for Boston, MA from the year 2022. Using this data, we created two modes: Tanning mode for those who simply want to be aware of the UV index, and UV-sensitive mode for those who are looking to protect themselves against stronger rays. These modes can be activated by pressing and holding this button, where the ascending tone indicates the tanning mode and the descending tone indicates the UV-sensitive mode.

The UV-sensitive mode will turn red once the UV reaches a level of 6 or higher to alert the user to take necessary action, like applying sunscreen or covering up, before stepping out for the day. To create this prototype, we used an Arduino board to connect a Neopixel strip for the light, an arcade button to switch between modes, and a piezo buzzer for mode change indication. The box was made through laser cutting, and the sun display was created by resin printing.

We hope that the UVision will bring more joy and comfort in people’s lives with its ability to whimsically emphasize UV!
